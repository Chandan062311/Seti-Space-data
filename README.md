# Seti-Space-data
### The data we are going to use consists of 2D spectrograms of deep space radio signals collected by the Allen Telescope Array at the SETI Institute. We will treat the spectrograms as images to train an image classification model to classify the signals into one of four classes. By the end we will built and train a convolutional neural network from scratch using Keras to classify signals from space.
